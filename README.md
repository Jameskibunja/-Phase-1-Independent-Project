DIGITAL SCHOOL BELL APP

JAMES KIBUNJA

Schools bells have always been an important part of our childhoods.With the emergence of new technology many things have been digitized, while the school bell still uses the old manual method. To solve this problem we can come up with a simple web program that ring when a specific time is set.

HOW IT WORKS
•	Web page that displays the current time
•	Drop down section that displays Hour & Minute option (for ringing time selection)
•	A button to set the desired time.

TECHNOLOGY USED
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JAVASCRIPT
